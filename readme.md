Pygame Tic-Tac-Toe

Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Pygame. Players take turns placing green crosses (Player 1) and red circles (Player 2) on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after each move and displays the winner in a banner with their respective color (e.g., "Player 1 wins!" or "Player 2 wins!"). If the game ends in a tie, it will display "It's a tie!". Players are then prompted with buttons to play again or quit.
